         <h4>Product Specification Engineer</h4>
         <span>Flexsteel Industries Inc.</span>
         <span>2015-2017</span>
         <ul>
          <li>
            Using functional programming in VBA to write excel macros, developed an application to automate a procedure documentation process. After implementing the application as standard operating procedure, five technicians were able to reduce total process time by 60 minutes per project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrote an application to verify SQL bill of materials versus work instruction bill of materials. By automating the process, the project was completed 3 weeks ahead of schedule.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborated with 3 other design engineers to produce new products for the recreational vehicle market using. Met with direct customers, suppliers and end users to understand project parameters, and communicate project progress through the development process. From this process, we were able to improve a supplierâ€™s turn around time on parts by improving our engineering drawing requirements.

        <h4>Design Engineer</h4>
        <span>Novinium</span>
        <span>2013 to 2014</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a functional prototype of an automatic liquid pump to dynamically regulate line pressure based on input readings from linear sensors, on high voltage underground power lines. Using historical data, and laboratory tests, our team was able to determine a relationship between the expansion of the polymer cable sheath and possibility of rupture in the line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programmed first prototype using a Arduino board and the Arduino modified C library.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created testing procedures and experiments to verify smart tanks effectiveness. Using statistical analysis, it was determined that for a 2% increase in rate of cable failure using the smart tank, fill times could be to half of traditional times. An added benefit of the dynamic pressure system was an improved fill of liquid in the cable.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Invented a mechanical pin pusher for manufacturing aerial work platforms. Previous pin pushers required hydraulic power and required 2x the footprint to operate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed schedules, objectives, and deliverables for process improvement events on the shop floor to keep teams focused on making value added discoveries using lean methodologies and creating best practices.
